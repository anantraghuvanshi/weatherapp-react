This is a weather forecast app made using React.</br>

I was occupied in the advance react course and found it very boring and time consuming so</br>
I thought to get my hands dirty and instead of learning I should be making some mini projects </br>
in which the concepts of advance react has been use such as hooks, effects and states.
